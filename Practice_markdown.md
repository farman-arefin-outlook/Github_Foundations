## Git Hidden Folder

There is a hidden folder called `.git` which tells you that our project is a git repo.

If we wanted to create a git repo in a new project we' create the folder and the initialize that repo using `git init`

```

mkdir /workspace/tmp/new-project
cd /workspace/tmp/new-project
git init
touch README.md
code README.md
# make changes to README.md

git commit -a -m "Add README.md

```

## Cloning

We can clone in three ways: HTTPS,SSH,Github CLI

```sh
mkdir /workspace/tmp
cd /workspace/tmp
```

### HTTPS

```sh
git clone https://github.com/farman-arefin-outlook/Github_Foundations.git
```
